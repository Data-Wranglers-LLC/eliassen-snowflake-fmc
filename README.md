# eliassen-snowflake-fmc

When run as pipeline by the VaultSpeed agent, the bash script and SQL objects transforms the JSON mapping file generated in the FMC package into a DAG (directed acyclic graph) of Snowflake tasks.

Contents: 
- snowsql_deploy_fmc.bash - Bash script for deploying the VaultSpeed FMC (Flow Management Control) to Snowflake
  This script:
- create_fmc_objects.sql - SQL script for creating Snowflake SQL opbjects executed in bash script
  Objects created:
  - Task schema ("TASKER") - schema where all task-related SQL resides
  - Task mapping table ("TASK_MAPPING") - table for storing FMC mapping JSON as variant during deployment
  - Load Cycle ID generator procedure ("GET_LOAD_CYCLE_ID") - generates unique load cycle id for each instance of DAG run and passes it into the subsequent tasks
  - Wrapper prcedure ("RUN_MAPPING_PROC") - procedure that runs the load procedures generated by VaultSpeed; it provides error logging and hands off the load cycle is from the previous task to the next one
  - DAG generator procedure ("CREATE_VS_FMC") - This procedure flattens the mapping JSON of load procedure names names and loops of over the mapping records, generating and executing the SQL to create each task
 
How to implement in your environment:
  1. In snowsql_deploy_fmc.bash, update the variables and default values between the ## BEGIN EDIT ## and ## END EDIT ## comment lines with the values for your environment.
     ## Update snowsql_deploy_fmc.bash here:  ##
    ## BEGIN EDIT ##
    snowsql_conn=ACCOUNT_ADMIN
    snowflake_warehouse=VAULTSPEED_WH
    agent_folder=/home/azureuser/agent
    task_schema=TASKER
    default_schedule="USING CRON 0 0 1 1 * America/New_York" ## Here, 01 January at midnight is the default when no schedule is available in the FMC definition
    use_start_dt_as_load_dt=Y #Sets load date for incremental loads to the start date selected when creating FMC workflow
    max_dep_per_grp=100 #Maximum number of dependencies per group
    snowsql_dir=/home/azureuser/bin/
    snowsql_config_path=/home/azureuser/.snowsql/config
    ## END EDIT ##
  3. Copy/replace this bash file into the agent folder in your VaultSpeed agent enviroment.
  4. Execute create_fmc_objects.sql queries in the target VaultSpeed database. BE AWARE that the old SQL objects, and any modification will be dropped and replaced.
